In some countries, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other websites are blocked due to political or other reasons, and we've optimized our network to provide you a reliable connection and you can enjoy your favorite videos and chat with your friends and family without any interruptions.<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n

Why Can't I Connect to VPN?<\/p>\r\n\r\n

First of all, you have to ensure that your local network connect to the Internet. Because VPN is a local network connection based service, if your local network can not work, VPN services will not work, either. To determine whether your local network is normal, please exit VPN then open your Web browser to see if you can visit the website as you usually do. Secondly, if your local network connection is normal, please re-open VPN then login username and password to see if there is an message prompting error in entering. If so, please enter the correct account information. Thridly, please make sure that your VPN service has not expired. If it expires, please complete the renewal as required. Finally, sometimes our VPN server may be temporarily interrupted. If you are sure that there are no problems with the above, please re-choose a VPN server and re-connect. If you still can not connect, please contact our online customer service via support email : onlyvpnorg@gmail.com<\/p>\r\n"}}
